## Technical Implementation

### Business Rules Implemented:
1. âœ… Late Delivery Penalty: â‚¹50 if delivery > (base time + 10 min)

3. âœ… High-Value Bonus: 10% bonus for orders >â‚¹1000 delivered on time
4. âœ… Fuel Cost: â‚¹5/km base + â‚¹2/km for high traffic
5. âœ… Overall Profit: (order value + bonus - penalties - fuel cost)
6. âœ… Efficiency Score: (On-time / Total) Ã— 100

### Data Loaded:
- âœ… 10 Drivers with shift hours and past week data
- âœ… 10 Routes with distance, traffic level, base time
- âœ… 50 Orders with values, routes, delivery times

### Testing:
- âœ… 5 Unit tests covering all business logic
- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… Error handling tested
